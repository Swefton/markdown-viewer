## It's Dangerous to Go Alone — Take This H2

This paragraph is here to test how your markdown text looks in a typical block of content.  
Now here's a manual line break above this one. Neat, huh?

## Emphasis Is Everything

*This text is just a little dramatic.*  
**This one is screaming.**  
***This one is screaming, dramatically.***

## Quote of the Day

> "Markdown: because sometimes, writing HTML feels like bringing a tank to a pillow fight."

## The Shopping List You Always Forget

- Milk  
- Bread  
  - Multigrain  
  - Whole wheat (the healthy guilt trip)  
- Chocolate (for emotional support)

## How to Adult, in Ordered Steps

1. Wake up (optional).  
2. Make coffee (mandatory).  
3. Pretend to be productive.

## Talking Nerdy

Inline code like `npm install` is perfect for terminal vibes.

### Code Block (JS Edition)

```js
function debugLife() {
  console.log("Why is this bug still here?");
}
debugLife();
```

## Escaping the Matrix

Sometimes you just want to show a `*` without *emphasizing* anything.

## Keyboard Shortcuts FTW

To screenshot like a pro: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

## Pay Attention!

<mark>Seriously, this part is super important.</mark>

## Drawing Diagrams Like It's the 21st Century

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Wake up] --> B{Is it before 10am?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Make coffee]
    B -- No --> D[Stare into the void]
    C --> E{Feeling productive?}
    D --> E
    E -- Yes --> F[Start coding]
    E -- No --> G[Binge cat videos]
    F --> H{Did it compile?}
    H -- Yes --> I[Deploy to production 🚀]
    H -- No --> J[Blame it on the intern]
    G --> J
    J --> K[Take a break. Try again later.]
```

## Code So Good, We Colored It

```python
def unleash_dragons():
    print("Here be dragons 🐉")

unleash_dragons()
```
